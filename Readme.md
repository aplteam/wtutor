This project is about the Dyalog APL workspace WTUTOR.DWS which is part of a standard Dyalog APL installation.

For working on code or variables (lessons) load the workspace "Development". `⎕LX` gives you everything you need to know.

The workspace `wtutor.dws` is what should be delivered to the end user. This workspace can be created from the `Development` workspace by calling `⍙Make_wtutor 1`.

The files `Report-Kai-{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}.html` in the `Reports/` folder give details about what I've done.
